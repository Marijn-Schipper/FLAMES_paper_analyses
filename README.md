# FLAMES_paper_analyses
This repo contains all the data and files needed to recreate the analyses in the FLAMES paper

Downloading and running the file Notebook_to_recreate_figures_FLAMES.ipynb will recreate all figures in the FLAMES paper, except for the SHAP values, which can be recreated in FLAMES itself, and the circosplot, which was manually created from the SYNGO sunburst plot and the geneset enrichment analysis results in the Supp. Table 14.
